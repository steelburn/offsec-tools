## Adalanche Query Language (AQL)

In order to query the internal Adalanche graph, you express your targets by issuing a search for starting nodes traversing zero to many edges and ending at a certain node.

Searches for nodes are defined more or less using LDAP query syntax, so the same options and requirements as when using eg. PowerShell with LDAP filters apply. Adalanche offers some more filters and expressions though in addition to standard AD LDAP filters.
